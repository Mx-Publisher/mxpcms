<a name="upload"></a><h2>2. Uploading the MXP Core</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>
<div class="content">

<p>As a rule without exception MXP and phpBB must be installed in different directories. Do not mix the files up!! If phpBB is not installed on your system, please visit <a href="www.phpbb.com/">www.phpBB.com</a> for further instructions.  When uploading the default directory structure which will cause you the least effort and quickest installation is as follows:</p> 

<p><code>/your/path/to/public/html/YOUR_PORTAL_NAME/</code> (this is the place were all MXP files should be located)<br />
<code>/your/path/to/public/html/YOUR_FORUM_NAME/</code> (this is the place where your working phpBB installation should be located)</p>

<p>You can alternatively install MX-Publisher in your root directory (which can be accessed via http://www.yourdomain.com/ while your forum can be installed in a folder along with the MXP folders (ie it'd be located in <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2/</code></p>

<p>Using the default setup above, the install path variables should be: <strong>phpBB Relative Path: ../YOUR_FORUM_NAME/</strong></p>

<strong><h4>Note #1</h4></strong> <p>If you move the phpBB folder into another one before installing MXP, the phpBB configuration <strong>(the <code>/phpbbroot/config.php</code> file)</strong> must also be modified to match the new phpB location.</p>

<strong><h4>Note #2</h4></strong> <p>The MXP and phpBB installations use completely differing config.php files. <strong>Do not confuse them and mix them together! They are two different files.</strong></p>

<strong><h4>Note #3</h4></strong><p> If you plan to switch to phpBB mode later (after a fresh standalone installation) you have to set the phpBB relative path manually in the MXP Admin Control Panel.

<p>Unzip the distributed MXP files and upload<strong></strong></p> 

<strong><h4>SPECIAL NOTE</h4> MX-Publisher needs write access/permissions to the cache folder and the mx_meta.inc file.</strong></p> 

<p><strong>## CHMOD (0777) THE FOLLOWING FILES/DIRECTORIES:<br /><br /><code>## - mxroot/cache/</code><br /><code>## - mxroot/mx_meta.inc</code></strong></p>

<p>For those with Windows servers, CHMOD 0777 gives read, write, and access permissions to all 3 auth types (commonly Owner, Group, and Other/Anonymous). You'll have to give the files/folders above these permissions; this depends from host to host, though usually you can do it via your hosting control panel (cPanel, DirectAdmin, etc.)

<a name="install"></a><h2>3. New installation</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>
<div class="content">

<p>In your browser, call <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/mxproot/install/mx_install.php</code> Replace "mxproot" with whatever name you had for your MXP folder, which contains all of the MXP files and folders.  You will now be presented with an installation page showing you some options, the first of which is the choice of MXP installtion, of which there are a possible 3 seperate types of install which you can choose from, lets take a look at these below:</p>

<h4>MXP - standalone (INTERNAL)</h4>
<p>This option will allow you to get your MXP install up and running without any need of 3rd party software - usually phpBB forum - it'll get your demo default website up and running quickly without the forum part.  At a later stage you can still choose from with the Admin Control Panel to select a type of phpBB forum software which you have installed - of which MXP supports two types; phpBB 2 and phpBB 3.</p>
<h4>MXP - With phpBB2 / phpBB3</h4>
<p>With the installer, all of the values should already be filled in, and you should be set up to go and click "Install." However, you should go over the information filled in. If you definitely need something changed, then go ahead and see this document for details on how to set the installer to allow you to enter your own settings. Note that you should only do this if you know what you are doing. 

<p>You then need to fill out the installation configuration form which consists of the following:</p> 

<h4>MX-Publisher Prefix in DB (default: mx_)</h4>
<p>This is the prefix name for the database - so when you browse through phpmyadmin you'll see it more clearly plus it prevents table mixups between other things in your database (such as phpBB) which has a database prefix of phpbb_.  Also you may want to change this if you want several instances of MXP present within the same database; for example mx2_ - this is not something highly recommended due to export and backup functions, extraction of data however.</p>
<h4>Database Type (default: mySQL)</h4>
<p>You wont have to change this option.</p>
<h4>Database Server Hostname/DSN</h4>
<p> The default: localhost is normally all that is required if you need to fill this in.</p>
<h4>Your Database Name</h4>
<p>This will be either the database which phpBB already uses or if you are planning on an enttirely internal (standalone) install you'll need to create a new one with your prefered db management tool. Sometimes the database name here requries a prefix of the domain name - which for example might be <code>www.testsite.com</code> with a database named <code>data1</code>; so the database name entry here would be testsite_data1.</p>
<h4>Database Username</h4>
<p>You need to enter the database username which was auto-created when your database was created OR create a db user, with appropriate db permissions.  Again this may require the website name as a prefix to the username.</p>
<h4>Database Password</h4>
<p>The password unlike the two previous entries which required your website as a prefix before either the database name or the database username <strong>DOES NOT</strong> need a prefix before it - enter this as per the normal password of the database user.
<h4>MXP Admin Username</h4>
<p>You may or may not want to consider keeping this the same as your phpBB forum install credentials for simplicity and to avoid confusion when switching around your website.</p>
<h4>MXP Admin Password</h4>
<p>Again - you may or may not want to consider keeping this the same as your phpBB forum install credentials for simplicity and to avoid confusion when switching around your website.</p> 
<h4>Re-enter MXP Admin Password</h4>
<p>Repeat the password you have just entered.</p> 

<p>Now That you have the correct information present you can click the Install button to continue, at this stage you'll be told you can download the config.php for you to upload directly to your sever into the MXP directory so this is your next step - click the button to download the config.php file and place it on your server.</p>
<p>You can now REFRESH the page and this will start the installation wizard placing entries into the database - the page will scroll showing you this, when finished you'll be presented with some instructions at the bottom fo the page.</p>
<p>These will tell you that you need to now delete two directories on your server: <code>/contrib/</code> and <code>/install/</code> once done you can then login to your brand new MXP installation.</p>

<a name="advance"></a><h2>4. Advanced Installation</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>
<div class="content">
<p>To choose your own configuration instead of the installer's default suggestions, open up the mx_install.php file in your favorite PHP or text editor and perform the following code changes to the file.<strong></strong></p>
<strong><h4>Find</h4></strong> <code>define('INSTALL_READONLY', true);</code><strong>
<h4>Replace With:</h4></strong> <code>// define('INSTALL_READONLY', true);</code></p>
 
<p> The purpsoe of this is to 'comment out' the code line - meaning that it will stop working and in turn allow you to set up your own configuration. 

<h4><strong>Note</strong></h4>
<p>The install script creates the MX-Publisher config.php file. If for some reason the install fails, you may need to remove the generated config.php manually before retrying the install. Also, if you feel like doing a fresh reinstallation, you will need to remove the previous MX-Publisher config.php file.</p>
<h5>Failure to do this action will result in a failure to install MXP and your install script will not update correctly.</h5></p>

Also, some webservers deny the installer the rights to edit the <code>config.php</code> file. In this case you'll need to CHMOD the config.php file to 0777. (CHMOD is overviewed above). If you have any other errors regarding config.php (you shouldn't), go here. 

2) Don't forget to remove the install/ and contrib/ folders after a successful installation! Otherwise, this could mean a potential security hole. 
3) Installation Complete!  Now enter the MX-Publisher AdminCP and configure the portal. The user interface is intuitive.

<h2>5. Upgrading the MXP Core</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

<p> Upgrading your installation is only a matter of a few steps to take and simple awareness of one or two facts.</p>

<ul>
		<li>Download the full package from the <a href="http://www.mx-publisher.com/page11/catlink11">Downloads Page</a> at www.mx-publisher.com.</li>
		<li>Unzip/unrar the contents - making sure the directory integrity remains intact.</li>
		<li>Open your FTP client and connect to your MXP directory</li>
        <li>Upload all files and folders <strong>except for config.php</strong>.</li>
		<li>Now visit the <code>mx_install.php</code>.</li>
        <br />
		<li>This will start the install wizard for your upgrade - follow all the steps then click Finish.</li>
        <li>Remove the <code>/install/</code> and <code>/contrib/</code> directories and you are free to login to your new portal.
	</ul>

<p>Do not forget to also upgrade all the modules to make sure you have full MXP compatibility.</div>

<a name="confirm"></a>
<h2>6. Confirmation</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>After successful installation of the MXP db tables, you'll be forwarded to the confirmation page, from where you are directed to the MXP Administration Control Panel, to&nbsp;finalize the installation, eg </p>
<ul>
	<li>define board timezone and other localized settings</li>
	<li>configure the server mail SMTP </li>
</ul>
<p>Further, in the MXP Administration Control Panel, additional modules can be installed. </p>

If you want to direct all calls from the phpBB AdminCP to the MX-Publisher AdminCP (the latter integrates the phpBB AdminCP within its own), do this:

Go to your /phpbbroot/admin/ directory.
Rename index.php to index_old.php
Copy the index.php in the phpbb/admin directory.

Edit index.php and replace "www.yourdomain.com" with your portal address.

## ABOUT

MX-Publisher CMS is a free open-source Web Content Management System written in PHP since 2001 as a fully modular portal and CMS for phpBB.

It features dynamic pages/blocks/themes by means of a powerful yet flexible Admin CP. While it uses integrated features, it works without touching phpBB.

        - item2
        - item2
        - section
            - item2
            - item2
            - item2
        - item2
    - item1
    - section
        - item2
        - item2
    - item1

Example of initializing:
  var menu = new DropDownMenuX("id_of_the_menu");
  menu.init();

Example of initializing and setting additional stuff:
  var ddmx = new DropDownMenuX("menu1");
  ddmx.type = "horizontal";
  ddmx.delay.show = 0;
  ddmx.delay.hide = 400;
  ddmx.position.level1.top = 0;
  ddmx.position.level1.left = 0;
  ddmx.position.levelX.top = 0;
  ddmx.position.levelX.left = 0;
  ddmx.fixIeSelectBoxBug = true;
  ddmx.zIndex.visible = 500;
  ddmx.zIndex.hidden = -1;
  ddmx.init();

! FEATURES

- position of submenus can be changed, so they can for example overflow parent elements
- on the same page there can be many menus created
- seperated into 3 layers: behaviour(javascript), structure(html), presentation(css)
- search engine friendly
- free for any use (BSD license) 

----------------
! COMPATIBILITY
----------------

Tested on: IE, Mozilla, Opera, Netscape, Firefox, Safari

Known CSS problems:
* Safari: setting margin > 0 for BODY element causes some positioning problems. Sections in the menu
  will be placed a few pixels away from the default place. The menu still works and is usable. To avoid
  these problems set "margin: 0;" for BODY element.
* IE: removing doctype causes that IE enables Backward Compatibility Mode and some CSS bugs can appear.
  Then you will need to edit .css file and make some fixes.
* IE: IMG tags (arrows) could be removed from html structure and right aligned background could be 
  set in .arrow class, but .. Internet Explorer has a bug - it doesn't cache CSS images. So if you have 20 arrows in menu
  ie will load them 20 times on each page request ! That can be annoying for users with slow connection, it also
  increases your bandwidth unnecessarily.

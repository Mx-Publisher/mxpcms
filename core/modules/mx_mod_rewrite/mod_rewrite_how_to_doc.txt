mod_rewrite for mxBB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Despite the tons of examples and docs, mod_rewrite is voodoo. Damned cool voodoo, but still voodoo."

-- Brian Moore

Requirements
------------

You need Apache server with module mod_rewrite enabled. 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html

Setup instructions for mxBB
---------------------------

Located in the contrib folder are located the files .htaccess and rewrite_custom_defs.php. These files should be moved as instructed:

mxBB_root/.htaccess (required)
mxBB_root/modules/mx_mod_rewrite/rewrite_custom_defs.php (optional)

The preconfigured "rules" will transform any portal url (http://domain/index.php?page=x) to an SEO alternative (http://domain/pagex). 
All Navigation Menu urls will apply to these rules.

Custom rules (defs)
-------------------

You may (optionally) define more rules, to make your site even more SEO and user friendly. Such additional rules are defined in
rewrite_custom_defs.php (mxBB side of things) and in the .htaccess file (server side of things). 
This distribution comes with a basic set of examples.

You will find two different subfolders in this contrib/ directory: replace_phpbb_admin , and sync_overall_header .

replace_phpbb_admin is meant to offer a way for users to access the mxBB AdminCP from phpBB side of things, replacing the phpBB AdminCP link in the footer.

sync_overall_header is a simple way of synchronizing the headers in both your portal and forum. And updated document related to installing themes for mxBB is located here: http://www.mx-publisher.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4741 .

Note that you will not find specific support for these methods at our support forums. These things are at-your-own-risk.

! MENU TYPES
----------------

#1.0 DropDownMenu1 - 1 level drop down menu (horizontal, vertical).
#1.1 DropDownMenuX - Drop down menu with unlimited nesting (horizontal, vertical).

! NOTES
----------------

Some of the menus include additional file to support IE 5.0:
<script type="text/javascript" src="../ie5.js"></script>
If you want to support IE 5.0 then you have to set a proper path to file ie5.js,
if you don't wanna support this version of browser just remove that line.

When no doctype is specified, Internet Explorer runs in "quirks" mode.
It is for backward compatibility, and many css bugs appear. If you want
to avoid them, use a doctype, not necessary xhtml.

for example:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
or
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

IE Bug #1 (nested tables):

Example not working on IE:

<table><tr><td><table><tr><td>
    <table id="menu">....</table>
    <script>.. init menu ... </script>
</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

Example that works on IE:

<table><tr><td><table><tr><td>
    <table id="menu">....</table>
</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
<script>.. init menu ... </script>

Difference:
Looks like initializing the menu on IE must be done after closing some tables.

So if you are using nested tables, initialize the menu at the end of the page
or use window.onload event:

<script>
window.onload = function() {
    .. init menu ..
}
</script>

! KNOWN PROBLEMS
----------------

* Opera - seems like there is no way to get the original href attribute from <a> elements,
  they are converted to absolute paths. This can be a problem in TreeBuilder. IE had the same
  problem, but a dirty hack helped to solve it.

* IE 5.0 - plugins don't work in TreeBuilder, Function.call() method is missing in its implementation.
